TO DO

- manual rate limiting?
- implement logging module instead of params
- look at fuzzysteve thing
- use requests url params wherever possible
- consider implementing DB early
- redo market history lookup to preserve typeID for each instance (use requests' .url attribute)
- decide where typeID:Name correlation belongs for _dangling_CSV.py (likely only for display, at end-point)
- fix problematic implementation of url_async(), as (foo for foo in bar) re-serialises it

AFTER TYPEID-SORT:

- attach name via corresponding typeid from csv

- attach market info (requires new lookup) such that
    data =
        [
            [
                {order1}, {order2}...
            ]
            [   {'volume:' 0, 'median:' 0, etc.}
            ]
        ]

- further separate into buy and sell

- sort sells descending; sort buys ascending

- add stuff like volume, median price, etc.

- introduce classes
